```

Parameters:

- `include_genres=action,sci-fi`: Comma-separated list of genres to include (strict filter).
- `exclude_genres=romance,slice of life`: Comma-separated list of genres to exclude (strict filter).

## Data Aggregation

The service aggregates the following data points for evaluation:

### Movies
- **Metadata (TMDB)**: Budget, Revenue, Production Companies, Genres, Release Date.
- **Cast/Crew (TMDB)**: Top 3 Lead Actors, Director, Writer.
- **Ratings**: Metacritic Score, Rotten Tomatoes Score, IMDb Rating, IMDb Vote Count, TMDB Average Vote, TMDB Vote Count.
- **Popularity**: TMDB Popularity Metric.
- **Preferences**: Supports `disliked_genres` for negative AI weighting.

### Anime
- **Metadata (AniList)**: Title, Studio, Genres, Granular Tags, Description, Status.
- **Consensus Scores**: MyAnimeList Score, AniList Average Score, Kitsu Average Rating.
- **Hype Signals**: Reddit Weekly Karma (via AnimeKarmaList), AniList Popularity & Trending.
- **Platform Signals**: Simkl Trending (Peer-based popularity).
- **Preferences**: Supports `disliked_genres` and `disliked_tags` for negative AI weighting.

## LLM Evaluation

The evaluation logic is unified across both Movies and Anime services. It supports multiple providers via `lib/ai.js`:
- **Google GenAI (Gemini)**: Primary provider if `GEMINI_API_KEY` is present.
- **Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)**: Secondary provider if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is present.
- **Fallback**: If no API keys are provided or evaluation fails, the service falls back to a weighted popularity/score ranking.

## Develop
